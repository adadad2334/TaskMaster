## Top Issues by Category

### Code Structure (10 warnings)
- Complex functions in assign.py exceeding recommended cyclomatic complexity
- Several functions in crud.py are too long (>50 lines)
- Some nested blocks are too deep (>5 levels)

### Documentation (6 warnings)
- Missing docstrings for some functions in routers
- Incomplete parameter documentation in some CRUD functions
- Missing return value types in some functions

### Naming Conventions (4 warnings)
- Some variable names are too short or not descriptive
- Inconsistent naming style in some modules

### Unused Code (3 warnings)
- Unused imports in several modules
- Some unused variables in error handling blocks

### Type Annotations (1 warning)
- Missing return type annotations in some functions

## Recommendations
1. Refactor complex functions in assign.py to reduce cyclomatic complexity
2. Add missing docstrings and improve existing documentation
3. Standardize naming conventions across all modules
4. Remove unused imports and variables
5. Complete type annotations throughout the codebase

## Action Plan
1. **High Priority**: Fix documentation issues to improve maintainability
2. **Medium Priority**: Refactor complex functions in assign.py and crud.py
3. **Low Priority**: Standardize naming conventions and type annotations

This analysis helps maintain code quality and ensures the project follows best practices for Python development.
